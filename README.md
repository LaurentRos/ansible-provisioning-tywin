# Fansible Tywin: manage your symfony provisioning

## Still WIP: not a reliable repository yet 

## Installation

Coming soon: installation with composer

## generate your provisioning

### Create the `.fansible.yml` file in the root diretory
Example:

  project_name: fansible-devops

  vagrant:
    ip: 10.0.0.10

### Run the script: `python vendor/fansible/tywin/generate.py`
You can now found your provisioning in the devops directory
